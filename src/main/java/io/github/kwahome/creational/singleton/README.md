## Singleton Pattern
Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a 
global access point to this instance.

Singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class and ensures that only one instance of the class exists in the 
java virtual machine. The singleton class must provide a global access point to get the instance of the class. 
Singleton pattern is used for logging, drivers objects, caching and thread pool.
