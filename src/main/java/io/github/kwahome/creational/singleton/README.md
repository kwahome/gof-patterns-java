## Singleton Pattern
Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a 
global access point to this instance.

Singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class and ensures that only one instance of the class exists in the 
java virtual machine. The singleton class must provide a global access point to get the instance of the class. 
Singleton pattern is used for logging, drivers objects, caching and thread pool.

## Problem
The Singleton pattern solves two problems at the same time, violating the Single Responsibility Principle:

- Ensure that a class has just a single instance.
- Provide a global access point to that instance.

## Participants
- `Singleton`: class declares the static method getInstance that returns the same instance of its own class.
The Singletonâ€™s constructor should be hidden from the client code. Calling the getInstance method should be the only 
way of getting the Singleton object.

## When to use this pattern
- When a class in your program should have just a single instance available to all clients; 
for example, a single database object shared by different parts of the program.
- When you need stricter control over global variables.
